**Design of an electric bike motor drive with no battery**

There are many types of electric bikes in the market, but all of them have bulky and expensive batteries with ranges up to 15-20 km. In this project, a small super capacitor will be used instead of a battery, which will be charged by regenerative braking when going down-hill. The charged capacitor will be used to assist the cyclist when going up-hill.

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
